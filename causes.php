Ali, Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, College of  </p><p>Pharmacy, University of Florida,2018)  </p><p>Specifically, the process aims at reducing procurement and carrying costs, while maintaining an effective stock of products to satisfy customer and prescriber demands. Managing materials (pharmaceutical products) in that process is an integral part of the business model for all pharmacy settings, especially community and hospital practices. On the other hand, inventory mismanagement causes unnecessary rise in procurement and carrying costs and an imbalance in the supply and demand equation ( Wiedenmayer K, Summers RS, 2006)  </p><p>  2.1.3 PHARMACY INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  Most pharmacy inventory decisions involve replenishment how much to order medicine, when to decide to order medicine, and when to place the order. There are three costs associated with pharmacy inventoried which including carrying costs, shortage costs and replenishment cost. For instance, the costs associated with running out of a medicine product used in critical care might well involve increased morbidity and mortality clearly an unacceptable situation. However, the basic tenets of this inventory control systems should be examined by hospital pharmacy managers and applied when appropriate. The availability of microcomputers and relatively powerful spreadsheets will increase the utility of complex models of inventory control that are too complicated for manual calculations.
